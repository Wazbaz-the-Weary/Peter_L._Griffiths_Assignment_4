Embedded link leads to a p5.js project mapping and displaying the NOAA data for [precipitation in Worcester County for the last 130 years](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/national/time-series/110/pcp/12/1/1895-2025) for which there are records. Examining the data for personal reference, Worcester county was in drought during the years of my freeshman and sophomore years at WPI, 2016-2017, where by 2019 we received the greatest average precipitation in recorded history. My goal going into this was to find a personal reference point to think about my time in Worcester, and how despite personal ups and downs a simple graph can put that time into better formed/formatted perspective.
